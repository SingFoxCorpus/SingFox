rms_normalization.py --> Applies RMS normalization to ensure consistent perceived loudness across files.

check_normatization.py --> Verifies whether files are properly normalized (checks peak and RMS levels).

merge_audio_files.py --> Merges all WAV files into a single long WAV file, with optional silence between clips.

divide_audio_file.py --> Splits each WAV file into fixed-length segments (e.g., 2 seconds) and saves them with consistent naming.
